J2ME Isometric Engine. (http://sourceforge.net/projects/isoj2me/)

An engine/framework for isometric games (like japanese RPGs) for mobile devices supporting J2ME (MIDP 1.0). 

This engine will manage maps, objects and characters.

A full Action-RPG using this library is going to be released... Stay tuned...
